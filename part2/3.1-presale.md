# 3.1 Public Presale (Blind‑Box): Fair, Simple, Transparent

To ensure a fair start, the first Ship and Land NFTs are offered in a public blind‑box sale. Rules are public, supply caps are clear, and everyone participates on equal footing.

**Fairness through randomness** Under the blind‑box approach, you can’t preselect the specific type (Merchant vs. Pirate / Wavecrest vs. Blackrock). Types are assigned randomly.

### Presale rules (concise)

| Asset Type | Mint Price (sol) | Total Supply |
| ---------- | :--------------: | :----------: |
| Ship NFT   |        0.6       |     1,000    |
| Land NFT   |         1        |      500     |

Choose a quantity and pay the corresponding amount; minting automatically stops when the cap is reached.

> Note: This sale uses a uniform price and fixed totals—no tiered pricing or time windows. If a transaction fails, no funds are deducted.
