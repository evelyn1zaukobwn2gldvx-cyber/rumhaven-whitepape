Unlike the mobile ships, land is an eternal strategic asset in the isles. Owning a piece of land means you have established a solid foundation in this emerging world. Like ships, each plot of land is a unique ERC-721 NFT, with its metadata generated and permanently recorded on-chain via the `LandNFT.sol` contract.

Land NFTs do not directly produce $RUM, but they are a powerful fleet-boosting asset. When you hold both a Land NFT and a Ship NFT in the same wallet, and their factions match, your ships will receive a significant performance bonus on their voyages.

The isles' lands are divided into two types based on their geographical features and strategic value, as recorded in the `kindOf` mapping:
* **Blackrock Heights (Kind 0):** Known for its rugged coastline, towering cliffs, and hidden natural coves, this land is the perfect hideout and base of operations for pirates. Lords of Blackrock Heights can provide strategic support to their pirate fleets, significantly increasing their success rate on high-risk voyages.
* **Wavecrest Plains (Kind 1):** With its gentle shores, safe deep-water harbors, and open hinterlands, this land is ideal for establishing a prosperous commercial hub. For merchants, it is the central nexus of their trade network. Lords of Wavecrest Plains can provide logistical and market advantages to their merchant fleets, boosting their $RUM yields on secure trade routes.
