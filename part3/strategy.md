**Scenario 1: The Optimized Pirate Plunder**
* **Asset Configuration:** A player owns a Pirate Ship (120 SP) and a matching Blackrock Heights land (+20 SP).
* **Route Selection:** They decide to challenge the Storm's End Plunder Zone (DC 140, Pirate faction modifier +20 SP).
* **Calculation:**
	* **Total Sailing Power** = 120 (Base) + 20 (Faction) + 20 (Land) = **160 SP**
	* **Success Rate** = (160 / 140) * 80% ≈ **91.4%**
* **Expected Outcome:** The player has a 91.4% chance of earning 70-90 $RUM after a 3-hour voyage, with only an 8.6% chance of returning empty-handed. This perfectly illustrates the massive advantage gained from asset synergy.

**Scenario 2: A Reckless Merchant Venture**
* **Asset Configuration:** A player owns only a Merchant Ship (100 SP) with no matching land.
* **Route Selection:** They mistakenly send this ship to the Storm's End Plunder Zone (DC 140, Merchant faction modifier -40 SP).
* **Calculation:**
	* **Total Sailing Power** = 100 (Base) - 40 (Faction) + 0 (Land) = **60 SP**
	* **Success Rate** = (60 / 140) * 80% ≈ **34.3%**
* **Expected Outcome:** The player has only a 34.3% chance of success on this 3-hour voyage and is highly likely to suffer a total loss. This case highlights the importance of strategy: merely owning an NFT is not enough. The key to wealth lies in strategically deploying assets based on their intrinsic attributes.
