**Core Stats**
* **Sailing Power (SP):** The base capability value of each ship.
	* Merchant Ship: 100 SP
	* Pirate Ship: 120 SP
* **Difficulty Class (DC):** The inherent challenge level of each route.

**Land Bonus (Strategic Synergy)**
* **Wavecrest Plains:** When held in a wallet, all Merchant Ships in that wallet gain +15 SP on all routes.
* **Blackrock Heights:** When held in a wallet, all Pirate Ships in that wallet gain +20 SP on all routes.

**Success Rate Formula**

Final Success Rate = ( (Base SP + Faction Modifier SP + Land Bonus SP) / Difficulty Class DC ) * 80%

*Note: The calculated final success rate is capped at 95%.*
