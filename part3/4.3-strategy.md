# 4.3 Strategic Walkthroughs

**Scenario 1: Optimized Pirate Plunder (concept)**
* **Loadout:** Pirate ship plus matching land.
* **Route:** High‑reward, high‑risk zone (e.g., Storm’s End Plunder).
* **Key point:** Matching ship, bonuses, and route timing can markedly raise success odds and payout range.

**Scenario 2: Reckless Merchant Venture (concept)**
* **Loadout:** Merchant ship only, no matching land.
* **Route:** Attempts a hard route with low chance to succeed.
* **Key point:** Owning NFTs alone is not enough; smart pairing and long‑term planning matter.
