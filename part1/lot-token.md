# 2.1 Lord's Offered Token ($LOT): The Key to the Inner Circle

$LOT is the community equity token of the Rumhaven Isles, launched as a fair launch on hypeevm with a fixed total supply. It is not the everyday currency of the game, but rather a "proof of stake" in the isles' high-level economic activities.

The core value of $LOT lies in its exclusive utility: it is the sole credential required to access the two core community treasury events managed by the "Governor's Hall."

The primary functions of $LOT are clear and powerful:
* To purchase tickets in the Governor's Lottery, competing for a massive $LOT prize pool.
* To be staked in the Merchant's Guild to earn passive $RUM income.
