# 2.2 The Governor's Lottery: A Game of Chance and Deflation

The Governor's Lottery is a simple, periodic drawing designed to be fun and rewarding for $LOT holders. Rules are transparent, settlement is immediate, and participation is straightforward.

**How It Works**

* **Tickets:** Use $LOT to buy lottery tickets. The default price is **1,000 $LOT per ticket** (subject to operational tuning).
* **Rounds:** Each round has exactly **100 tickets**. When the 100th ticket is sold, the round draws immediately and the next one starts automatically.

**Value & Prize Pool**

* **Deflation:** **10%** of every ticket is burned, supporting long‑term $LOT scarcity.
* **Pool Growth:** The remaining **90%** goes to the current round’s prize pool and seeds the next round.

**Prize Distribution (defaults)**

* **Grand Prize:** **50%** of the pool to one winner.
* **Second Prize:** **20%** of the pool split among up to 10 winners.
* **Next Round Seed:** **30%** rolls over to keep every round attractive.

> The Founder's Bounty: Instant $RUM Fun
>
> To enhance participation, the system can inject a $RUM reward budget (e.g., 100,000 $RUM). On purchase, players may receive instant $RUM via:
>
> * Buyer’s Bonus: A fixed $RUM amount per ticket (configurable).
> * Milestone: Extra $RUM every Nth ticket (configurable).
> * Lucky: A chance‑based extra $RUM on any ticket (configurable).

### Key Notes (non‑technical)

* Ticket price and tickets per round may be adjusted over time (defaults: 1,000 LOT / 100 tickets).
* Each purchase burns 10% of LOT; 90% enters the prize pool.
* Pools split 50%/20%/30%; any remainder rolls into the next round.
* Instant $RUM rewards are limited by the pre‑funded budget to ensure safe, sustainable distribution.

> Note: If the instant‑reward budget is temporarily low, payouts will match available funds or be deferred to keep the system stable.
