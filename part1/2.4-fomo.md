# 2.4 Keys & Countdown (FOMO)
![Keys & Countdown](../fomo3d.png)

The "Keys & Countdown" event lets participants purchase **Keys** with $LOT. Each key extends the round timer; when the timer finally reaches zero and no further keys are bought, the last buyer wins the entire prize pool.

**Core Mechanics (Summary)**
* **Price Ladder:**
  * Keys 0–100: 1,000 LOT each
  * Keys 101–200: 2,000 LOT each
  * 201+ keys: price starts at 2,000 LOT and increases by 10 LOT per key
* **Timer Extension:** Every key purchase extends the countdown. Extensions are larger in the final hour; no round exceeds 24 hours.
* **Distribution:** Each purchase allocates LOT to the prize pool, dividends, burn, and community treasury. The prize pool is paid to the last buyer when the round ends.

**How to Participate**
1. Approve the contract to spend your LOT.
2. Buy one or multiple keys.
3. Keep an eye on the countdown and strategic timing.
4. When the round ends, the contract automatically distributes the prize pool.
