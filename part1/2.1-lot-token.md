$LOT is the Isles’ advanced participation credential. It is not a routine in‑game currency; it is the key that unlocks “advanced economic activities” such as the Lottery and Staking.

 

As an ecosystem credential, $LOT’s supply follows the issuance strategy (testnets may be mintable). More importantly, the Lottery provides continuous deflationary pressure—**10%** of every ticket is burned.

The core value of $LOT lies in exclusive access: it is the sole credential for two core activities.

Its primary functions are straightforward:
* Buy tickets in the Governor’s Lottery to compete for the $LOT prize pool.
* Stake in the Merchant’s Guild to earn passive $RUM.

### Liquidity support (brief)

During the LOT launch, the team will purchase $RUM and provide initial liquidity to improve market depth, reduce early volatility, and make participation smoother. Details will be disclosed transparently via official channels.
