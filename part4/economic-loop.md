# 5.3 The Wealth Cycle of Rumhaven

<!-- Publication styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/styles.css">

The economy of the Rumhaven Isles is a self-reinforcing, closed-loop system.

Entry: Players use Hype to participate in the Genesis Auction, acquiring their first Ship and Land NFTs.

Production: Players dispatch their Ship NFTs on "Fortune's Voyage," producing $RUM through strategic combinations of ships, land, and routes. This is the primary source of $RUM.

Advanced Gameplay: Players acquire $LOT (via the secondary market) and use it to:
* Stake in the Merchant's Guild to share in $RUM from the initial reward pool.
* Participate in the Governor's Lottery to win the $LOT jackpot and share in $RUM from the initial reward pool.

Value Loop:
* The lottery system burns 10% of all $LOT revenue, creating deflationary momentum for $LOT.
* As the game's core output, future consumption sinks for $RUM will create sustained demand, supporting its value. This, in turn, incentivizes players to continue investing in and upgrading their NFT assets to engage more deeply with the game.

This cyclical design ensures every part of the ecosystem has a clear purpose, collectively forming a dynamic and sustainable economic model.

The loop is intentionally tight to re-circulate value back into the gameplay economy and the community treasury.
