# 5.2 $RUM Tokenomics

 

To ensure the healthy development of the $RUM economy, we have designed clear supply limits and an allocation plan.


**Maximum Supply:** The max supply of $RUM is hard-capped at **1,000,000,000** tokens.

| **Play-to-Earn (P2E) Rewards** | 60% | 600,000,000 | Released through gameplay and campaigns; paced and controllable. |
| **Ecosystem Fund** | 15% | 150,000,000 | Small initial release; remaining linearly over ~24 months to build the ecosystem. |
| **Team** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Subject to lockups and long‑term vesting to align with project success. |
| **Advisors** | 3% | 30,000,000 | Locked and released in tranches for professional support. |
| **Liquidity & Initial Rewards** | 7% | 70,000,000 | Initial liquidity and market incentives, including early event rewards. |
| **Reserve & Partnerships** | 5% | 50,000,000 | Strategic reserve for partnerships and growth, with governance oversight. |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1,000,000,000** | |

### Emission & Vesting Highlights

- P2E is the primary circulating source and releases alongside gameplay and campaign pacing.
- Team and advisor allocations include standard lockups and vesting to align with long‑term goals.
- Liquidity and rewards support smooth markets and community incentives, with transparent pacing.

### LOT Launch Liquidity Note

During the LOT launch, the team will allocate a portion of proceeds to acquire $RUM and provide initial liquidity in order to:
- Improve early $RUM depth and reduce slippage;
- Make it easy for players to access $RUM for gameplay.

All such actions will be announced through official channels with clear accounting of amounts and destinations.
