# 5.3 The Wealth Cycle of Rumhaven

 

The economy of the Rumhaven Isles is a self-reinforcing, closed-loop system.

Entry: Players participate in the public Presale using the native token, acquiring their first Ship and Land NFTs.

Production (current phase): Players earn $RUM mainly via ecosystem incentives — staking in the Merchant's Guild and participating in the Lottery. "Fortune's Voyage" will be introduced iteratively to deepen strategy and long‑term planning.

Advanced Gameplay: Players acquire $LOT (via the secondary market) and use it to:
* Stake in the Merchant's Guild to share in $RUM from emission campaigns.
* Participate in the Governor's Lottery to compete for the $LOT jackpot while receiving $RUM button rewards.

Value Loop:
* The lottery system burns 10% of all $LOT revenue, creating deflationary momentum for $LOT.
* As the game's core output, future consumption sinks for $RUM will create sustained demand, supporting its value. This, in turn, incentivizes players to continue investing in and upgrading their NFT assets to engage more deeply with the game.

This cyclical design ensures every part of the ecosystem has a clear purpose, collectively forming a dynamic and sustainable economic model.

> Note: The loop intentionally re‑circulates value back into the gameplay economy and the community treasury.
