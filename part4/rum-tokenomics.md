# 5.2 $RUM Tokenomics

<!-- Publication styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/styles.css">

To ensure the healthy development of the $RUM economy, we have designed clear supply limits and an allocation plan.


**Maximum Supply:** The max supply of $RUM is hard-capped at **1,000,000,000** tokens.

| Category | Percentage | Amount | Description & Vesting Schedule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Play-to-Earn (P2E) Rewards** | 60% | 600,000,000 | Minted dynamically by the game contract based on player activity; uncapped per-block emission constrained by gameplay parameters. |
| **Ecosystem Fund** | 15% | 150,000,000 | 10% released at TGE; remaining 90% linearly vested over 24 months with milestone-based governance releases. |
| **Team** | 10% | 100,000,000 | Locked for 12 months, then linear vesting over 36 months with cliff protections. |
| **Advisors** | 3% | 30,000,000 | Locked for 6 months, followed by linear vesting over 18 months. |
| **Liquidity & Initial Rewards** | 7% | 70,000,000 | Used at TGE for initial liquidity and marketplace incentives; includes 200,000 $RUM reserved for early event rewards. |
| **Reserve & Partnerships** | 5% | 50,000,000 | Strategic reserve for long-term partnerships and ecosystem growth; subject to multisig governance approvals. |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1,000,000,000** | |

### Emission & Vesting Highlights

- P2E emissions are the primary source of circulating $RUM and are driven by on-chain gameplay outcomes.
- Team & advisor allocations include standard lockups and vesting to align incentives with long-term success.
- Liquidity & rewards allocation ensures smooth market function and community event funding.

### LOT Launch Liquidity Note

As part of the LOT token launch mechanics, the team will earmark a defined portion of LOT sale proceeds to acquire $RUM on open markets and provide initial $RUM liquidity (e.g., via LP pools). This is intended to:
- Support immediate market-making for $RUM and reduce initial slippage.
- Ensure that early participants and players can access $RUM for gameplay without excessive friction.

All liquidity actions will be documented on-chain where possible and communicated via official channels, with clear accounting of amounts and destination (liquidity pools or reserve wallets).
