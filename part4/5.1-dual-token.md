# 5.1 The Dual-Token Model

 
The economy of Fomo Ocean is driven by a carefully designed dual-token model, where each token plays a unique and complementary role.

 

**RUM (ecosystem currency)**
* **Role:** Reward and utility token of the ecosystem. In the current phase, RUM is primarily distributed via Staking and Lottery incentives; the voyage features will roll out gradually.
* **Economics:** Emitted over time in planned budgets/campaigns; issuance and sinks evolve to serve long‑term health.
* **Value drivers:** In‑game usage and future consumption sinks (events, items, services).

**LOT (access credential)**
* **Role:** The credential for advanced activities (Lottery, Staking) and community rights.
* **Economics:** Supply follows the issuance strategy (testnets may be mintable). The Lottery adds continuous deflationary pressure: **10%** of every ticket is permanently burned.
